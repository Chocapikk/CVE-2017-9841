## **VulnerabilityScanner for PHPUnit RCE**

A specialized vulnerability scanner developed to identify and interactively exploit the Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in PHPUnit's `eval-stdin.php`. This vulnerability affects PHPUnit versions before 4.8.28 and 5.x before 5.6.3 and allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via HTTP POST data.

### **Description of the Vulnerability:**

The `Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php` file in PHPUnit, in versions prior to 4.8.28 and 5.x before 5.6.3, has a vulnerability allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code. An attacker can exploit this by sending HTTP POST data starting with a `<?php` substring. This poses a significant threat to sites with an exposed `/vendor` directory, giving external access to the `/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php` URI.

### **Features:**

- Mass scanning sourced from a list of URLs.
- Interactive shell mode for single target exploitation.
- Efficient scanning with multi-threading.
- Neat and color-coded console outputs using `rich`.
- Export feature for vulnerable URLs.

### **Installation:**

Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Usage:**

- Conduct a mass scan using a list of URLs, and output vulnerable ones:
```bash
python exploit.py -f path_to_file_with_urls.txt -o output_vulnerable_urls.txt
```

- Interact with a specific URL using the shell:
```bash
python exploit.py -u target_url
```

### **Arguments:**

- `-f, --file`: Provide a list of base URLs for scanning from a file.
- `-u, --url`: Enter the target URL for interactive shell mode.
- `-o, --output`: Designate a file to store detected vulnerable URLs.
- `-t, --threads`: Specify the number of threads. Defaults to `10`.
